# Implementation of the Naive Bayes Theorem to solve the Kaggle Santander challenge

In this notebook, I present a simple implementation of the Naive Bayes Theorem to solve the closed Kaggle competition on the Santander transaction challenge. The basic idea of this notebook was inspired in other Kaggle's user notebook - Chris Deotte - who shared his solution and proposed the use of the Bayes Theorem.

All details and further explanations can be found inside the notebook itself.
